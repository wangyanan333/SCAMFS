# SCAMFS: State-level Causal Asymmetry Modeling for Multi-label Feature Selection

## Introduction

**SCAMFS** is a causal feature selection algorithm specifically designed for **Multi-label Learning**. The core innovation lies in shifting from traditional **label-level** feature selection to a more granular **state-level** analysis. By modeling dependencies between specific label states and utilizing **State-Specific Mutual Information (SSMI)** and **Differential State Mutual Information (DSMI)**, the algorithm discovers local causal structures to accurately identify feature subsets with explanatory power for specific label values.
